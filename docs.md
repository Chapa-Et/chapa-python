response = chapa.initialize(
    email="customer@example.com",
    amount=1000,
    first_name="John",

)
print(response)
```

### Verifying Payments

After initiating a payment, you can verify the transaction status using the `verify` method.

```python
transaction_id = "your_transaction_id"
verification_response = chapa.verify(transaction_id)
print(verification_response)
```

You can create subaccounts for split payments using the `create_subaccount` method.

```python
subaccount_response = chapa.create_subaccount(
    business_name="My Business",
    account_name="My Business Account",
    bank_code="12345",
    account_number="0012345678",

    account_name="Recipient Name",
    account_number="0987654321",
    amount="500",
    reference="your_transfer_reference",
    bank_code="67890",

)
print(transfer_response)
```
